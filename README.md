Jeuring's algorithm on palindromes

pldrm.pdf is the documentation generated from pldrm.tex.
pldrm.nw is the noweb (literating programming) source file, which generates pldrm.tex and pldrm.cc.

I have also written up a short summary for the algorithm, but the pseudocodes are not tested:
jeuring_palindrome.tm is the TeXmacs source file, and jeuring_palindrome.pdf is the generated PDF file.
